Persistence-of-Vision LED Clock


This is an LED clock that makes use of persistence-of-vision to display time and temperature. The time can be set using the rotary encoder and 2 buttons (there are 3, but one was not used in the current iteration).


This project was made in collaboration with 2 others: Joshua Sevick and Kolby Kriegelstein.

I, Jesse Thompson, was responsible for the PCB design, Real-time Clock (RTC), and implementing the rotary encoder's drivers in the RTC. All group members made their own drivers for the UART, ADC (for temperature), and bar of 16 LED's.
